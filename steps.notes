// this app.js will have a frontend code

//Step 1 Check if browser supports geolocation

//step 2 Set options for high accuracy, a 5 second timeout, and no caching

//step 3 Use watchPosition to track the users location everytime

//step 4 Emit the latitude and longitude via a socket with "send-location"
//log any errors to the console

//step 5 Initialise a map centered at coordinates (0, 0) with a zero a zoom
// level of your choice I am considering 15

//step 6 Create an empty object marker

//step 7 When receiving location data via the socket, extract id, latitude, 
//longitude and center the map on the new coordinates

//step 8 If a marker for id exists, uodate its position otherwise create a 
//new marker

//step 9 When user disconnects, remove their marker from the map and delete 
//it from markers.

// -------This is the whole stuff I have to code------
//Chalo lets do itðŸš€
